# Titanic_Kaggle
This is my solution of Titanic Machine Learning Competition on Kaggle.
My first attempt was to use Logistic Regression in Python.
My second attempt was to use XGBoost in Python. It gave a higher result.
Parameter objective='multi:softmax' in XGBoost Model gave better result than 'objective':'binary:logistic'.
